This is a project done by a superior colleague to translate alphabet  and signs into dots and dashes
it is mainly for transmiting messages to a second party codedly
My work on it is to make it interactive and communicable while handling errors from the libray.
Also working on adding to the libray to improve the functionality.

Mordification is still ongoing and am open to opinions.

Thank you.
