This project was carried out to determine the strength of a password entered by a user.

The strength is judged based on the type of character entered by the user.

character used involves : upper case letters (A-Z), lower case letters (a-z), number from (0-9), and special characters which are common to users like !,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),_,-,+,[,],\,|,},{,<,>,?,/,:,',;,".

The strength used in this context is equivalent to the number of times either hours,days, month, years and so on it would take an hacker to decode the password.

This project is subject to the changes as time goes on. Thank you.
